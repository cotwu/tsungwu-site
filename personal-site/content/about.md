## About Me

I am an anesthesiologist at National Taiwan University Hospital, Hsinchu Branch, based in Hsinchu, Taiwan.

Outside the operating room, I am an active squash player and a certified strength and conditioning coach (Level C, Monster Training). My involvement in sports and coaching has shaped how I think about performance, feedback, and skill development in clinical education.
