## Academic Anesthesiologist · Clinician-Educator · Clinical Researcher

I am an anesthesiologist at National Taiwan University Hospital, Hsinchu Branch, with primary interests in perioperative physiology, patient safety, and medical education.

My work focuses on how anesthesiologists think, decide, and act under uncertainty, and how structured education and monitoring-informed practice can improve perioperative outcomes.
