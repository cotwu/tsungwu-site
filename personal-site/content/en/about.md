## About Me

Based in Taipei and Hsinchu, Taiwan, I work at the intersection of clinical practice and education.

In teaching, I emphasize performance, timely feedback, and structured skill development to support long-term clinical growth.

Outside the operating room, I enjoy squash and I am a certified strength and conditioning coach (Level C, Monster Training).
